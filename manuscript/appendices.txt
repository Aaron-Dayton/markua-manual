## Markdown Headings

Whereas Markua [defines exactly one way](#headings) of making every type of heading, Markdown defines two syntaxes for making headings: "Setext" and "atx". For the purpose of contrast, this section explains how headings are done in Markdown.

{#setext_headings}
### Setext Headings in Markdown

In the Setext-style of headings, top level headings can be made by adding a row of equals signs `========` below the heading, and second level headings can be made by adding a row of minus signs `--------` below the heading:

These are some Setext headers in Markdown:

```
This is an h1
=============

This is a paragraph.

This is also an h1 (really)
=

This is a paragraph.

This is an h2
-------------

This is a paragraph.

This is also an h2 (really)
-

This is a paragraph.
```

There are two main issues with this style of heading in Markdown:

1. It is inconsistent: It only supports defining `h1` and `h2`; to define h3 and below, the atx style of heading must be used.
2. It is confusing: Authors are confused about how many equals or minus signs you need to use. (As we saw above, the answer is 1, which looks disgusting.) Also, it's unclear whether you need to add a blank line below the row of equals signs or minus signs, and whether a heading is still produced if this is not done.

{#atx_headings}
### atx Headings in Markdown

In Markdown, the other heading syntax is "atx" headers. The [atx format](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/intro) was created by Aaron Swartz in 2002, and is an important predecessor to Markdown. To create an atx heading, you put the following on a line by itself, with a blank line above and below it: between one and six pound signs (`#`), followed by one or more spaces or tabs, followed by text, followed optionally by whitespace and any number of `#` characters. The number of `#` characters determines the level of heading.

These are some atx headers in Markdown:

```
# This is an h1

This is a paragraph.

# This is also an h1 ####################

This is a paragraph.

## This is an h2

This is a paragraph.

## This is also an h2 ###################

This is a paragraph.

### This is an h3

This is a paragraph.

### This is also an h3 ##################

This is a paragraph.
```

Note that all the trailing `#` characters are ignored and are not part of the heading text.

From reading this, you'll recogrize that [Markua headings](#headings) are a subset of atx headers.
