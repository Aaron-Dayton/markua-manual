# Asides

Asides are text which is formatted separately from the main text by a Markua processor. Asides can span multiple pages.

Asides can be created like block quotes, but using `A>` line prefixes. The same rules for newlines apply.

#### Example

##### Markua Syntax

{#input_aside_1}
```
This is a paragraph before the aside.

A> This is a paragraph in the aside.
A>
A> This is a
A> second paragraph in the aside
A> which contains newlines.
A>
A> This is a third paragraph in the aside.

This is a paragraph after the aside.
```

##### HTML Output

The HTML output for an Aside is simply a `div`, not a `section` or an `aside`, since an arbitrary aside is not something which is a top-level element of a book. (Also, some legacy EPUB readers would choke on `section` or `aside`.)

{#output_aside_1}
```
<p>This is a paragraph before the aside.</p>
<div class="aside">
<p>This is a paragraph in the aside.</p>
<p>This is a<br/>
second paragraph in the aside<br/>
which contains newlines.</p>
<p>This is a third paragraph in the aside.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a paragraph after the aside.</p>
```
