# Audio

The Markua audio syntax can be briefly described as follows:
`![Optional Alt Text](path_or_url_to_audio "Optional Figure Caption")`

In Markua, audio can be inserted using the Figure syntax, on a line by itself.

The optional figure caption is described in the [Figures](#figures) section below; the alt text and image path are described below.

## Defining Audio Inline

In the Markua audio syntax, just as with the Markdown image syntax, the optional alt text is in square brackets before the image:
`![Optional Alt Text](path/to/image.png "Optional Figure Caption")`

`![Optional Alt Text](path/to/audio.mp4 "Optional Figure Caption")`

## Defining Audio by Reference

[meow]
: path/or/url/to/audio.mp4 "Optional Figure Caption A"
: path/or/url/to/replacment/audio.webm "Optional Figure Caption B"
: path/or/url/to/replacment/image.png "Optional Figure Caption C"
: path/or/url/to/replacment/image.png "Optional Figure Caption C"

[meow]: path/or/url/to/audio.mp4 "Optional Figure Caption"

[meow]
: path/or/url/to/audio.mp4 "Optional Figure Caption"

on Leanpub, if URL not path, then add link to audio (as footnote?) on the caption of the fallback image as a footnote. spec that markua allows lots of markup around audio...
