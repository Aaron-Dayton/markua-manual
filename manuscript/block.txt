# Block Elements

As Markua is inspired by Markdown, there are two types of elements in Markua: Block Elements and Span Elements.

Every block element in Markua is separated from every other block element in Markua by at least one blank line. (This is not just one newline: a blank line is formed by the addition of two newlines.)

Note that there is an assumed blank line at the top and bottom of each Markua file, so at the top of a file you only need a blank line below the first block element, and at the bottom of a Markua file you only need a blank line above the last block element. You cannot make a block element span Markua source files--there is always a blank line added by the addition of two newlines during the concatenation.

Block elements can also have attributes. These modify the block element that they are attached to. An attribute is associated with the block element below it; to learn more see [attributes](#attributes).

Span elements are always contained inside a block element.

Markua is a plain-text format designed for the writing of books and documents.

Since Markua is a format in which all semantic and syntax formatting is typed by the author, we want Markua to be as readable as possible and as economical of keystrokes as possible.

Almost all formatting in Markua means the same thing regardless of whether the Markua document is being used to generate a book or document. The one huge exception to this, however, is in headings.
