# Block Quotes

Block quotes can span multiple pages. They are created by prefacing lines with `> `, i.e. a greater than character followed by a space.

A blockquote can contain other block-level elements, most commonly paragraphs. To start a new block level element within a blockquote, just put a line starting with a `>` followed by an optional space. It is equivalent to placing a `> ` in front of every line of the paragraphs.

Block quotes can be multi-paragraph. To create a multi-paragraph block quote, you need to separate each paragraph with a line containing a `>` and whitespace only.

Single newlines inside a block quote do not start new paragraphs. Instead, they simply add a line break, which produces a `<br/>` in HTML. This is identical to how single newlines inside a top-level Markua paragraph function.

A> The nesting of block quotes in Markdown is not supported in Markua.

A> Note that any headings inside block quotes, asides and blurbs do not show up in the Table of Contents. They can also be formatted differently by Markua Processors.

### Examples

#### Example 1: A Block Quote Containing Three Paragaphs

##### Markua Syntax

{#input_block_quote_1}
```
This is a paragraph before the block quote.

> This is a paragraph in the block quote.
>
> This is a
> second paragraph in the block quote
> which contains newlines.
>
> This is a third paragraph in the block quote.

This is a paragraph after the block quote.
```

##### HTML Output

The HTML output for a block quote is simply a `div`, not a `section` or an `aside`, since an arbitrary block quote is not something which is a top-level element of a book.

TODO - does `<blockquote>` cause problems for EPUB readers?

{#output_block_quote_1}
```
<p>This is a paragraph before the block quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a paragraph in the block quote.</p>
<p>This is a<br/>
second paragraph in the block quote<br/>
which contains newlines.</p>
<p>This is a third paragraph in the block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a paragraph after the block quote.</p>
