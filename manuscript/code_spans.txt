# Code Spans

Code like `hello world` can be inserted using backticks inside a paragraph, heading, or any other block element.

## Example

### Markua Syntax

```
Here is some `hello world` span code.
```

### HTML Output

```
<p>Here is some <code>hello world</code> span code.</p>
```

### Example Output

Here is some `hello world` span code.

## Two Backticks to Enclose One Backtick

Just as with Markdown, to show a literal backtick, you use *two* backticks to start and end your code span. (The Markdown spec says multiple backticks; Markua says exactly two.)

Note that like Markdon, any leading or trailing spaces in a code span are removed.

### Markua Syntax

```
Here is some ``code with a backtick (`) in it`` and other text.

If you want to have a backtick by itself, just use you need to have spaces around it like this `` ` ``. The enclosed backtick cannot start or end the code block.
```

### HTML Output

```
<p>Here is some <code>code with a backtick (`) in it</code> and other text.</p>
<p>If you want to have a backtick by itself, just use you need to have spaces around it like this <code>`</code>. The enclosed backtick cannot start or end the code block.</p>
```

### Example Output

Here is some ``code with a backtick (`) in it`` and other text.

If you want to have a backtick by itself, just use you need to have spaces around it like this `` ` ``. The enclosed backtick cannot start or end the code block.
