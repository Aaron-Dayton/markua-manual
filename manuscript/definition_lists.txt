# Definition Lists

A> While Definition Lists are called lists, they're a very different type of animal from unordered and ordered lists. So, they're treated separately.

Definition lists are supported in Markua. Although [some people](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/72395/is-it-possible-to-have-definition-lists-in-markdown) don't see the value in definition lists in HTML, we strongly believe in their value. Specifically, with the rise of mobile and the narrower screen reading experience becoming the new default, we see definition lists as having more of a future than tables. But instead of just being two columns, the idea of a definition list has actual meaning.

To define a definition list in Markua, use the following syntax:

```
term 1
: definition 1

term 2
: definition 2
```

The term cannot start with a square bracket--this is reserved for the reference-style image syntax.

A definition list can define multiple definitions for a term:

```
term 1
: definition 1a
: definition 1b

term 2
: definition 2
```

Note that a single term definition list is a definition list, regardless of how many definitions for the term exist.

```
term
: definition
```

For an example of a longer, more useful definition list used in Markua, see the [definitions](#definitions) section of this specification.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Markua Syntax

```
foo

term 1
: definition 1

term 2
: definition 2a
: definition 2b
: definition 2c

term 3
: definition 3

bar
```

#### HTML Output

```
<p>foo</p>
<dl>
  <dt>term 1</dt>
  <dd>definition 1</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>term 2</dt>
  <dd>definition 2a</dd>
  <dd>definition 2b</dd>
  <dd>definition 2c</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>term 3</dt>
  <dd>definition 3</dd>
</dl>
<p>bar</p>
