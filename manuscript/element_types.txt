# Block Elements, Span Elements and Metadata

Broadly speaking, Markua defines three things: block elements, span elements and metadata.

* Every block element in Markua is separated from every other block element in Markua by at least one blank line. (This is not just one newline: a blank line is formed by the addition of two newlines.)
* Span elements are always contained inside a block element.
* Metadata is typically attached to a block or span element, either above the block element or after the span element.

## Block Elements

The following are the block elements in Markua:

* [Headings](#headings)
* [Paragraphs](#paragraphs)
* [Scene Breaks](#scenebreaks)
* [Unordered Lists](#unorderedlists)
* [Ordered Lists](#orderedlists)
* [Definition Lists](#definitionlists)
* [Block Quotes](#blockquotes)
* [Asides](#asides)
* [Blurbs](#blurbs)
* [Code Blocks](#codeblocks)
* [Tables](#tables)
* [Math Blocks](#mathblocks)
* [Resources as Figures](#figures)

## Span Elements

The following are the span elements in Markua:

* [Text Semantics: Italics, Emphasis, Bold, Strong, Strikethrough, Superscript and Subscript](#textsemantics)
* [Links](#links)
* [Footnotes](#footnotes)
* [Crosslinks](#crosslinks)
* [Code Spans](#codespans)
* [Math Spans](#mathspans)
* [Soft Hyphens](#softhyphens)
* [Inline Images](#inlineimages)

## Metadata

The following are the types of metadata in Markua:

* [Attributes](#attributes)
* [Index entries](#indexentries)
* [Directives](#directives)
* [Settings](#settings)

## Blank Lines and File Concatenation

There is an assumed blank line at the top and bottom of each Markua file, so at the top of a file you only need a blank line below the first block element, and at the bottom of a Markua file you only need a blank line above the last block element. You cannot make a block element span Markua source files--there is always a blank line added by the addition of two newlines during the concatenation.
