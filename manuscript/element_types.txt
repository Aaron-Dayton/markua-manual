# Block Elements, Span Elements and Metadata

Broadly speaking, Markua defines three things: block elements, span elements and metadata.

* Every block element in Markua is separated from every other block element in Markua by at least one blank line. (This is not just one newline: a blank line is formed by the addition of two newlines.)
* Span elements are always contained inside a block element.
* Metadata is typically attached to a block or span element, either above the block element or after the span element.

## Block Elements

The following are the block elements in Markua:

* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Scene Breaks
* Unordered Lists
* Ordered Lists
* Definition Lists
* Block Quotes
* Asides
* Blurbs
* Code Blocks
* Tables
* Math Blocks
* Images as Figures

## Span Elements

The following are the span elements in Markua:

* Emphasis (Italics, Emphasis, Bold and Strong)
* Links
* Footnotes
* Crosslinks
* Code Spans
* Math Spans
* Soft Hyphens
* Inline Images

## Metadata

The following are the types of metadata in Markua:

* [Attributes](#attributes)
* Index entries
* Directives
* Settings

## Blank Lines and File Concatenation

There is an assumed blank line at the top and bottom of each Markua file, so at the top of a file you only need a blank line below the first block element, and at the bottom of a Markua file you only need a blank line above the last block element. You cannot make a block element span Markua source files--there is always a blank line added by the addition of two newlines during the concatenation.
