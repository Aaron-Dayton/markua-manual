# Images

Just as in Markdown, in Markua images can be defined in one of two ways:

Inline
: The image is defined right where it is inserted.

Reference
: The image is defined separate from where it is inserted, and it is inserted in one or more places in the manuscript.

Regardless of whether it is Inline or Reference, an image can also inserted in one of two ways:

Span
: The image is inserted as part of the flow of text of a paragraph.

Figure
: The image is inserted on a line by itself. If there are blank lines above and below the Figure then it is top-level; if there are no blank lines above and below the figure then it is inserted directly in the paragraph that it is in.

## Inline Images

The Markua image syntax can be briefly described as follows:

`![Optional Alt Text](path/to/or/url/of/image "Optional Figure Caption")`

This is the preferred way in Markua to insert normal images which are only used once. The optional alt text and the optional figure caption are discussed after the Reference Images syntax is explained, since they are relevant for both syntaxes.

## Reference Images

In this syntax, an `id` is first defined for an image, like this:

`[image_id]: path/to/or/url/of/image "Optional Figure Caption"`

It is also acceptable to use a definition list style, and put the path on a subsequent line after the colon.

```
[image_id]
: path/to/or/url/of/image "Optional Figure Caption"
```

The square bracket at the beginning of the line instructs the Markua processor that this is media, not a definition list.

This `id` can then be used to insert an image, like this:

`![Optional Alt Text][image id]`

Note that the Optional Figure Caption is defined with the `id`, and this figure caption is used every single time the image is inserted via its `id`.

The reference style of image definition and insertion is supported for the following four reasons:

1. If an author who is familiar with Markdown strongly prefers it, there's no reason not to provide it. (There's nothing else that Markua would do with the reference syntax.)
2. For images which are used frequently (e.g. emoji), it is much better to define it once and use it multiple times.
3. For videos, the reference style of video definition allows multiple sources to be defined, as well as a fallback to image. So, if the reference style of video definition is supported, it would be capricious of Markua to not support the image reference style it's based on.
4. The reference style of images is very similar to definition list syntax, so some authors might just prefer it.

## Alt text

In the Markua image syntax, just as with the Markdown image syntax, the optional alt text is in square brackets before the image insertion.  This is true for both inline and reference style of image insertion:

* Inline: `![Optional Alt Text](path/to/or/url/of/image "Optional Figure Caption")`
* Reference: `![Optional Alt Text][image id]`

The Optional Alt Text is text which is intended to take the place of the image if the image itself cannot be seen. The obvious use case is for readers with visual disabilities who are using a screen reader, but it also includes audiobooks and ebook readers which do not display images.

While the alt text is optional, it is important to have alt text. This is one reason why the image syntax puts it in the square brackets before the image path: you need to type the square brackets whenever inserting an image, so you might as well type some alt text. Empty square brackets look ugly--like a mistake--and it's a mistake to ignore the needs of readers with visual disabilities.

The alt text should not be the same thing as the figure caption, if the figure caption is present. (Imagine having your screen reader read identical alt text and figure captions to you.) Instead, the alt text should be descriptive of the image content, while the figure caption can be more creative. For example, a figure caption may be "Washington Crossing the Delaware" and the alt text could be "Denzel Washington riding a jet ski in a river". Having good alt text would enable readers who cannot see the image to still get the joke which the figure caption makes.

## Image Path or URL

The `path_to_or_url_of_image.png` part is the relative path to the image inside the `images` directory or the URL of the image on the internet. Both of these methods are described next.

### Images Path Approach

The `images/` directory is not included in the path in the Markua manuscript; it is present in the generated HTML.

All images identified with a directory path must be inside the `images` directory or one of its subdirectories. Implementors of Markua Processors must ensure they do not support navigating upward with `../` in paths.

A file called `foo.jpg` in the `images` directory is referenced as `![](foo.jpg)` -- not as `![](/foo.jpg)`, `![](images/foo.jpg)` or  `![](/images/foo.jpg)`.

A file called `bar.png` in a subdirectory `foo` of the images directory is referenced as `![](foo/bar.png)` -- not as `![](/foo/bar.png)`, `![](images/foo/bar.png)` or  `![](/images/foo/bar.png)`.

W> In Leanpub Flavoured Markdown, we included the `images/` in the path of all images. This is not supported in Markua. Not only is it redundant, it incorrectly implies that the directory could be named anything, which is not the case. So, if there is images/ in a path, a Markua processor **must** assume this is the name of a directory *inside* the images directory.

### Images URL Approach

The URL approach with an image is simple: the URL is an absolute URL of an image on the internet. The URL must start with with either `http:` or `https:`; no other protocols are supported.

## Supported Image Types

Markua supports GIF, PNG, JPEG and SVG images. All images must be located inside the `images` directory, regardless of type. The images must have the correct file extension for their type. Markua processors do not need to parse images to determine their type.

The supported file extensions are:

.gif
: The file is treated as a GIF image.

.jpg
: The file is treated as a JPEG image.

.jpeg
: The file is treated as a JPEG image.

.png
: The file is treated as a PNG image.

.svg
: The image is treated as an SVG image.

.svgz
: The image is treated as an SVG image which has been zipped.

.xml
: The image is treated as an SVG image.

## Span Images

Images can be inserted as a span image in the flow of text in a paragraph. When an image is inserted as a span image, it must be positioned where it is inserted -- it cannot be floated and repositioned by Markua processors.

A span image cannot have a caption. If a caption is present, a Markua processor will ignore it. (A Markua processor may add a warning to the list of warnings which are reported in book generation, but no warning is added to the text itself.)

## Figures

The most powerful way to insert an image in Markua is as a Figure. To do this you add an image on a line by itself.

A figure can be inserted in one of two ways:

Block
: The figure has blank lines above and below it.

Span Block
: The figure has no blank lines above or below it.

A Figure can have a caption, which is shown associated with the image (typically above or below it). This caption shows up in two places:

1. Near the image, typically above or below it, per the preference of the Markua Processor.
2. As the name of the Figure in the List of Illustrations (a.k.a. Table of Figures), if one is generated for the book. The caption name serves as the text, and it is a crosslink to the image caption associated with the figure itself.

Like the alt text, the figure caption is optional.

A figure can also have attributes.



: `float`, `width` and `type`. These are optional, and are expressed in an attribute list above the image. The `float` and `width` turn into inline style tags in the HTML, so if you find that distasteful, then don't do it. (You can always add a `class` attribute to an image, and style that class yourself if you prefer.)

`float`
: The `float` refers to where on the page the image is floated, and can have value of `left`, `right` or `none`. The default is `none`. If the value is `left` the image is floated left; if the value is `right` the image is floated right. If the value is `none`, the image is not floated. Instead, the image is centered on the page, and text does not wrap around it. The `none` value is equivalent to not specifying a value of `float`. Regardless of the value of `float`, the figure caption (if present) is positioned near the image per the preference of the Markua processor.

`width`
: The `width` specifies the width of the image. It is either `auto`, `fullbleed` or an integer between between `1` and `100` inclusive. The default is `auto`, which means to respect the actual size of the image, with a default maximum width of 100% of the page, respecting margins. The value of `fullbleed` means to advise a Markua Processor generating a PDF to resize the image to the full width of the page, ignoring margins. (In the HTML output this just adds a class of `fullbleed` and sets the width to `100%`, and CSS can be used to do whatever the author or book designer chooses to accomplish the fullbleed effect.) The integer values between 1 and 100 mean to resize the image to that percentage width of the page, respecting margins--so `100` means to be 100% of the usable page width, but not spilling into the margins.

`type`
: For an image, the `type` attribute is redundant, as the default type of a Figure is `image`. However, if you feel like it, you can add the `type` attribute with the value `image` if you choose. The reason that the `type` attribute exists on a figure is to allow the figure variant of the image syntax to also support inserting [audio](#audio) and [video](#video); see those chapters for details.

## Examples

#### Example 1: Span Images with Alt Text

Images can be inserted as a span image with alt text. Again, the alt text is intended to be read or heard instead of the image by readers who can't see the image, so it's important.

#### Example 3: Span Images Incorrectly Having a Caption

A span image cannot have a caption. If one is present, it is ignored.

##### Markua Syntax

```

#### Example 4: Figures with Alt Text and a Caption

Ideally, a figure should have both alt text and a caption. The alt text is intended for readers who can't see the image, and the caption is intended to complement the image.

##### Markua Syntax

{#input_figures_1}
```
Markua has a fancy logo:

![the word Markua with the two asterisk trees beside it](markua-logo.png "The Markua Logo")

Markua also has a fancy Twitter avatar:

#### Example 5: Figures with no Alt Text or Caption

Images can be inserted as a figure even with no alt text or caption. If this is done, the image is still styled as a figure, but the image has no caption and does **not** show up in the List of Illustrations.
