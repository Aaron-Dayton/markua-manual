# Rules and Guidelines for Implementors of Markua Processors

This entire spec is a set of rules and guidelines, but there are a few specific things to call out here:

* Markua Processors should have one comprehensive list of warnings to show Markua authors upon generating a Markua document with warnings in it.
* Markua Processors must not output generation errors and warnings into the text itself.
* Markua processors should provide warnings in situations where they can detect issues (e.g. "duplicate cross-reference", "not understood programming language", "unknown math processor", etc).
* Markua processors must not explode when encountering unsupported features that have legal Markua syntax (e.g. an unknown Math dialect or human language).
* Links to cross-references that don't correspond to an id that exists may either be created as a (broken, non-functional) link or be created as normal text (not a link).
* Crosslinks that reference an unused id may either be created as a (non-functional) link or be created as normal text (not a link) by a Markua Processor. The Markua Processor may also output a warning about this somewhere, but not in the actual document text itself.
