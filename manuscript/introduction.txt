# Introduction: The Magical Typewriter

Imagine you owned a magical typewriter.

When you used this magical typewriter, you wrote with fewer distractions. You didn't just write better, you wrote faster.

With this magical typewriter, you would never think about layout. The book would format itself.

You could create an ebook from your manuscript with one click. All ebook formats would be created, and they'd all look good. You'd have PDF for computers, MOBI for Kindle, and EPUB for everywhere else. The book would look great on phones.

With this magical typewriter, you could publish your book before it was even done, and get feedback from readers all over the world. You could automatically share book updates with them, so whenever you published a new version with one click all your readers would have it instantly.

With this magical typewriter, you could easily compare your manuscript to any other version of the manuscript that had ever existed. If you had a publisher and a development editor, they could easily do this too.

When the book was done, the magical typewriter would generate InDesign with one click, as a starting point for producing a great looking print book.

Wouldnâ€™t it be great if such a magical typewriter existed?

It can exist. At Leanpub, we like to think that we're building it.

But the key to being able to build such a magical typewriter is to create a simple, coherent, open, plain text format for a book manuscript.

This simple format will be the basis for the magical typewriter.

This simple format is called Markua.

This is its specification.
