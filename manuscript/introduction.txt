# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LEANPUB AUTHORS: MARKUA IS NOT IN LEANPUB YET

**Markua support is NOT live in Leanpub yet for anyone but admins. Heck, Markua is not even fully-specified yet. This spec is in-progress.**

If you're reading this, you are a really, *really* early adopter of Markua.

I'm publishing the Markua spec in-progress, since I believe in [Lean Publishing](https://leanpub.com/lean). (Lean Publishing is the act of publishing an in-progress book using lightweight tools and many iterations to get reader feedback, pivot until you have the right book and build traction once you do.)

We should have Markua live in Leanpub the next 2-3 months.  In the meantime, what Leanpub books are written in is what they have been written in for about 5 years: [Leanpub Flavoured Markdown, which is documented at this link](https://leanpub.com/help/manual).

The good news is that Leanpub Flavoured Markdown is very similar to Markua. So, if you've been thinking that you were writing in Markua and then wondered why a couple things didn't work, it's because they work differently in Leanpub Flavoured Markdown.

When Markua support is live on Leanpub we will provide the option of writing either in Markua or in Leanpub Flavoured Markdown. We'll also have a 1-click "Convert my Manuscript to Markua" button.

So, in the meantime, please enjoy using Leanpub and Leanpub Flavoured Markdown.

I'm really sorry for the confusion that this has caused some Leanpub authors.

Thanks,
Peter Armstrong

# The Magical Typewriter

Imagine you owned a magical typewriter.

When you used this magical typewriter, you wrote with fewer distractions. You didn't just write faster, you wrote better.

With your magical typewriter, you never worried about layout. The book formatted itself.

You could hit a key on your magical typewriter to create an ebook from your manuscript with one click.

All ebook formats would be created, and they'd all look good. You'd have PDF for computers, MOBI for Kindle, and EPUB for everywhere else. The book would look great on phones.

With your magical typewriter, you could publish your book before it was even done, and get feedback from readers all over the world. You could automatically share book updates with them. You would press one key on your magical typewriter to publish a new version, and all your readers would have it instantly.

With your magical typewriter, you could easily compare your current manuscript to any other version of your manuscript that had ever existed.

When the book was done, if you decided to make a print book, you could press a key on your magical typewriter to generate InDesign with one click. Your designer or publisher could use this as a starting point for producing a great looking print book.

With your magical typewriter, you'd only have to do one thing: Write.

Wouldn't it be great if such a magical typewriter existed?

It does. At Leanpub, we're building it.

But there's one requirement for this magical typewriter to exist: a simple, coherent, open source, free, plain text format for a book manuscript.

This simple format is what authors will write their books in, instead of Word. It will enable an ecosystem of tools to emerge around it.

This simple format will be the basis for the magical typewriter.

This simple format is called Markua.

This is its specification.
