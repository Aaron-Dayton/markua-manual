# Important Changes From Leanpub Flavoured Markdown

There are lots of changes in Markua from Leanpub Flavoured Markdown (or LFM). The most notable changes are:

* manuscript.txt for single-file books / documents
* In multi-part-books, `#` is Part (not `-#`), `##` is Chapter (not `#`) and `###` is Section (not `##`). (In books without parts, which is the default in Markua, the behaviour is the same as in Leanpub Flavoured Markdown.
* There is only one type of bulleted list delimiter, the asterisk (`*`).
* In a numbered list, the number that begins the list is the number that begins the list in the output (as opposed to the output always starting with 1).
* In a numbered list, numbers must be consecutive. You're not allowed to start every entry with `1.`.
* There's no support for indented code blocks.
* There is no support for comments (which are not output) in a Markua document.
