# Math Spans: Verbose and \{$$}

Math can be inserted as span elements as well as as a [block element](#math-blocks).

To do this, there's a verbose syntax and a syntactic sugar syntax.

The verbose syntax:

```
blah blah {math: mathml}here's your math{/math: mathml} blah blah

blah blah {math: latex}math here too!{/math: latex} blah blah
```

Note that since these are span elements, LaTeX math will look a lot better than MathML.

Also, this is very verbose. So, this is also supported:

```
blah blah {$$}math here too!{/$$} blah blah
```

This uses the default math engine. Chances are if you're using this syntax, you're using LaTeX math.

Here's a longer example:

### Markua Syntax

```
The four kinematics equations are {$$}d = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2{/$$}, {$$}v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a d{/$$}, {$$}v_f = v_i + a t{/$$} and {$$}d = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f) t{/$$}.
```

### HTML Output

Markua processors can do whatever they want here as well.
