# Paragraphs and Line Breaks

When writing normal prose, you break your writing into paragraphs.

Like every block element, a paragraph has a blank line both above and below it.

The distinguishing thing about a paragraph is that there is nothing else distinguishing about it. All block elements that are not some specialized type (like a heading, or like all the remaining block elements below) are paragraphs.

Note that since two newlines are added between all Markua files during the concatenation of multiple-file Markua documents, there is an assumed blank line at the top and bottom of each Markua file. So, as with all other block elements, you cannot make a paragraph span Markua source files.

## Examples

{#paragraphs_1}
