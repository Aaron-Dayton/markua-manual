## Paragraphs

Like every block element, a paragraph has a blank line both above and below it.

The distinguishing thing about a paragraph is that there is nothing else distinguishing about it. All block elements that are not some specialized type (like a heading, or like all the remaining block elements below) are paragraphs.

Note that since two newlines are added between all Markua files during the concatenation of multiple-file Markua documents, there is an assumed blank line at the top and bottom of each Markua file. So, as with all other block elements, you cannot make a paragraph span Markua source files.

### Examples

{#paragraphs_1}
#### Example 1

Here's an example of three paragraphs...

##### Markua Syntax

{#input_paragraphs_1}
```
This is a paragraph. The number of sentences does not matter.

This is another paragraph.

This is a third paragraph.
```

##### HTML Output

{#output_paragraphs_1}
```
<p>This is a paragraph. The number of sentences does not matter.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a third paragraph.</p>
```

##### Example Output

This is a paragraph. The number of sentences does not matter.

This is another paragraph.

This is a third paragraph.

## Scene Breaks

To make a scene break, place exactly three hyphens on a line by themselves. Scene breaks must have a blank line above them and below them.

Markua Processors can take great liberties in how they display scene breaks in non-HTML outputs. For example, scene breaks can be displayed as a few centered asterisks, an image, or just a blank line, depending on whether the book is fiction or another type of book.

Scene breaks map to the `hr` element in HTML.

### Example

#### Markua Syntax

```
Yada yada yada.

---

Yada yada yada.
```

#### HTML Output

```
<p>Yada yada yada.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Yada yada yada.</p>
```

#### Example Output

Yada yada yada.

---

Yada yada yada.

## Poetry

Poetry is easily supported in Markua: just hit a single newline to force a line break.

This works great for sonnets: you can write them just by typing. No fancy formatting is required to produce them.

New stanzas can be created by adding a blank line, just as would happen with new stanzas.

Note that the "two space trick" for line breaks is neither supported nor necessary in Markua: every newline in a normal paragraph produces a line break, regardless of whether there are any trailing spaces.  Two newlines produce a new paragraph or stanza.

If you wish to write e e cummings style monospaced typewriter poetry, you should do this in a code block with a `code` attribute of `poetry`.

### Example 1: A Shakesperean Sonnet

Shakespeare could have sat down and typed this in Markua:

#### Markua Syntax

```
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
     As any she belied with false compare.
```

#### HTML Output

<p>
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br/>
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br/>
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br/>
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br/>
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br/>
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br/>
And in some perfumes is there more delight<br/>
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br/>
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br/>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br/>
I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br/>
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any she belied with false compare.<br/>
</p>

#### Example Output

### Example 2: e e cummings Style Poetry

If you want to write e e cummings style poetry, go for it:

###### Markua Syntax

~~~
{code: poetry}
```
i am a cat
                        a        l a z y          cat
         me   ow
```
~~~

###### HTML Output

{class: warning}
B> TODO

{code: poetry}
```
i am a cat
                        a        l a z y          cat
         me   ow
```

###### Example Output

{code: poetry}
```
i am a cat
                        a        l a z y          cat
         me   ow
```
