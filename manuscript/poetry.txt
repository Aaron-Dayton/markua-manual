# Poetry

Poetry is easily supported in Markua: just hit a single newline to force a line break.

This works great for sonnets: you can write them just by typing. No formatting characters are required to produce poetry. This is appropriate, since formatting characters are not very poetic.

New stanzas can be created by adding a blank line, just as would happen with new stanzas when typed on a typewriter or written with a quill pen.

Note that Markdown's "two space trick" for line breaks (in which two trailing spaces are added to the end of a line to force a line break) is neither supported nor necessary in Markua: every newline in a normal paragraph produces a line break, regardless of whether there are any trailing spaces. (In fact, trailing spaces are ignored.)  Two newlines produce a new paragraph or stanza.

If you wish to write e e cummings style monospaced typewriter poetry, you should do this in a code block with a `code` attribute of `poetry`. Some programmers think of code as poetry--this is the inverse.

#### Example 1: A Shakesperean Sonnet

Shakespeare could have sat down and typed this in Markua:

##### Markua Syntax

```
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
    And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
    As any she belied with false compare.
```

#### Example 2: e e cummings Style Poetry

If you want to write e e cummings style poetry, go for it:

##### Markua Syntax

~~~
{code: poetry}
```
i am a cat
                        a        l a z y          cat
         me   ow
```
~~~

##### HTML Output

{code: poetry}
```
i am a cat
                        a        l a z y          cat
