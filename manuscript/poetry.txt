# Poetry

Poetry is easily supported in Markua: just hit a single newline to force a line break.

This works great for sonnets: you can write them just by typing. No fancy formatting is required to produce them.

New stanzas can be created by adding a blank line, just as would happen with new stanzas.

Note that the "two space trick" for line breaks is neither supported nor necessary in Markua: every newline in a normal paragraph produces a line break, regardless of whether there are any trailing spaces.  Two newlines produce a new paragraph or stanza.

If you wish to write e e cummings style monospaced typewriter poetry, you should do this in a code block with a `code` attribute of `poetry`.

### Example 1: A Shakesperean Sonnet

Shakespeare could have sat down and typed this in Markua:

#### Markua Syntax

```
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
     As any she belied with false compare.
```
