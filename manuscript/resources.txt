# Resources: Images, Audio, Video, Code, Math and Text

A> THIS IS IN FLUX AND IS BEING REWRITTEN

Markua books and documents are written in plain text, either in one text file or multiple text files. However, modern books and documents are not just text. Books and documents embed many types of *resources*. These resources have traditionally included things like images, computer code listings and mathematical equations. More recently, with the development of ebooks and formats like EPUB3, ebooks have gained the ability to embed audio and video resources.

Resources vary in three different ways:

1. Location: Local and Web
2. Insertion: Span and Figure
3. Type: Image, Code, Math, Text, Audio and Video

While this seems complex, it's important to emphasize that Markua resource syntax is just Markdown's inline image syntax, extended to support the resource types, figure captions and other attributes required by Markua. The details of all this will be described later, but it's useful to show how this fits together briefly first.

A> The reference style image syntax of Markdown is **NOT** supported in Markua. In something as large as a book, the potential for id collisions in link definitions using the reference link syntax is a lot higher than in the blog post length of typical Markdown documents.

The syntax to define and insert a resource is as follows:

```
![Optional Alt Text](resource_path_or_url "Optional Figure Caption")
```

The `resource_path_or_url` is either the relative path to the resource inside the `resources` directory or the absolute URL of the resource on the internet. In the case of images, audio and video, this becomes the `src` attribute of the resource in HTML.

The default type of a resource is `image`. For other types of resources, the type must be specified as an attribute.

```
{type: audio}
![Optional Alt Text](audio_resource_path_or_url "Optional Figure Caption")
```

Other attributes can also be added, for resources where they are appropriate. For example, video resources support a `poster` attribute, which is used as the image to show before the video is played.

```
{type: video, poster: poster_url}
![Optional Alt Text](resource_path_or_url "Optional Figure Caption")
```

Code blocks are also just a resource in Markua. (Code spans are not, since they cannot have attributes or captions.)

```
{type: code, language: ruby}
![Optional Alt Text](code_path_or_url "Optional Figure Caption")
```

Some types of resources can be defined inline in the Markua text itself. This includes image resources of type SVG, as well as math, code and text resources. It emphatically does *not* include audio and video resources!

Before discussing resource location, type and insertion it's important to discuss the Optional Alt Text. (The Optional Figure Caption is discussed later.)

## Optional Alt Text

In the Markua resource syntax, just as with the Markdown image syntax, the optional alt text is in square brackets before the resource insertion.

This is text which is intended to take the place of the resource if the resource itself cannot be seen. In the case of images, the obvious use case is for readers with visual disabilities who are using a screen reader, but it also includes audiobooks and ebook readers which often do not support embedded images, audio and video.

While the alt text is optional, it is important to have alt text. This is one reason why the image syntax puts it in the square brackets before the image path: you need to type the square brackets whenever inserting an image, so you might as well type some alt text. Empty square brackets look ugly--like a mistake--and it's a mistake to ignore the needs of readers with visual disabilities.

The alt text should not be the same thing as the figure caption, if the figure caption is present. (Imagine having your screen reader read identical alt text and figure captions to you.) Instead, the alt text should be descriptive of the image content, while the figure caption can be more creative. For example, a figure caption may be "Washington Crossing the Delaware" and the alt text could be "Denzel Washington riding a jet ski in a river". Having good alt text would enable readers who cannot see the image to still get the joke which the figure caption makes.

A> Alt text does not make sense for code or text resources, and it does not make much sense for math resources. (It could make sense for math resources if the mathematical equations are turned into an image or are rendered using a math library not supported by a given ebook reader, however.) Regardless of this fact, it does make sense to use the same syntax for all resources. In a case where there is no appropriate alt text, it can be omitted by using empty square brackets, like `![](resource_path_or_url)`.

## Optional Figure Caption

## Resource Location: Local and Web

In terms of where they are located, there are two types of resources: local and web.

Local Resources
: The resource is included with the manuscript files, in a `resources` folder inside the `manuscript` folder.

Web Resources
: The resource is defined somewhere on the web, and is available via the `http:` or `https:` protocols.

All Markua Processors must support all types of Local Resources. However, due to the nightmare that is current copyright law, support for Web Resources is optional in Markua Processors. Furthermore, support for Web Resources is not all or nothing -- a Markua Processor can support Web Resources for some resource types but not others. For example, a Markua Processor could support Web Resources for code, math and text, but not for images, audio and video. If a Markua Processor does not support a particular type of Web Resource, it must consider all Web Resources of to be missing resources at the time of book or document generation, and use fallback resources or alt text if provided.

### Local Resources

The `resources/` directory is not included in the path in the Markua manuscript; it is present in the generated HTML.

All images identified with a directory path must be inside the `resources` directory or one of its subdirectories. Implementors of Markua Processors must ensure they do not support navigating upward with `../` in paths.

The local resources approach can also be used by hosted services. If they provide a download they should create a resources directory... TODO

A file called `foo.jpg` in the `resources` directory is referenced as `![](foo.jpg)` -- not as `![](/foo.jpg)`, `![](resources/foo.jpg)` or  `![](/resources/foo.jpg)`.

A file called `bar.png` in a subdirectory `foo` of the resources directory is referenced as `![](foo/bar.png)` -- not as `![](/foo/bar.png)`, `![](resources/foo/bar.png)` or  `![](/resources/foo/bar.png)`.

W> In Leanpub Flavoured Markdown, we included `images/` in the path of all images. This is not supported in Markua. If  Not only is it redundant, it incorrectly implies that the directory could be named anything, which is not the case. So, if there is resources/ in a path, a Markua processor **must** assume this is the name of a directory *inside* the resources directory.

### Web Resources

The URL approach with an image is simple: the URL is an absolute URL of an image on the internet. The URL must start with with either `http:` or `https:`; no other protocols are supported.

## Resource Insertion: Span and Figure

Regardless of whether an resource is defined inline or by reference, an resource can also inserted into the flow of a Markua document in one of two ways:

Span
: The resource is inserted as part of the flow of text of a paragraph.

Figure
: The resource is inserted as a figure, either nested in a paragraph like a block quote or as a top-level element.

When inserting an resource as a span element in the flow of a paragraph, Markua Processors will want to use a very small (possibly emoji-sized) thumbnail for the resource. Otherwise, the paragraph would quickly look ridiculous, as a typical resource thumbnail is many times the height of a typical line of text.

{#spanimages}
### Span Resources

Images can be inserted as a span image in the flow of text in a paragraph. When an image is inserted as a span image, it must be positioned where it is inserted -- it cannot be floated and repositioned by Markua processors.

A span image cannot have a caption. If a caption is present, a Markua processor will ignore it. (A Markua processor may add a warning to the list of warnings which are reported in book generation, but no warning is added to the text itself.)

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Span Images with Alt Text

Images can be inserted as a span image with alt text. Again, the alt text is intended to be read or heard instead of the image by readers who can't see the image, so it's important.

### Figures

The most powerful way to insert a resource in Markua is as a Figure.

A figure is always inserted on a line by itself. However, there is variation in whether there is space above or below the figure:

Block
: The figure has blank lines above and below it.

Span Block
: The figure has no blank lines above or below it.

A Figure can have a caption. This caption shows up in two places:

1. Near the image, typically above or below it, per the preference of the Markua Processor.
2. As the name of the Figure in the List of Illustrations (a.k.a. Table of Figures), if one is generated for the book. The caption name serves as the text, and it is a crosslink to the image caption associated with the figure itself.

A figure can also have attributes. There are three attributes: `float`, `width` and `type`. These are optional, and are expressed in an attribute list above the image. The `float` and `width` turn into inline style tags in the HTML, so if you find that distasteful, then don't do it. (You can always add a `class` attribute to an image, and style that class yourself if you prefer.)

`float`
: The `float` refers to where on the page the image is floated, and can have value of `left`, `right` or `none`. The default is `none`. If the value is `left` the image is floated left; if the value is `right` the image is floated right. If the value is `none`, the image is not floated. Instead, the image is centered on the page, and text does not wrap around it. The `none` value is equivalent to not specifying a value of `float`. Regardless of the value of `float`, the figure caption (if present) is positioned near the image per the preference of the Markua processor.

`width`
: The `width` specifies the width of the image. It is either `auto`, `fullbleed` or an integer between between `1` and `100` inclusive. The default is `auto`, which means to respect the actual size of the image, with a default maximum width of 100% of the page, respecting margins. The value of `fullbleed` means to advise a Markua Processor generating a PDF to resize the image to the full width of the page, ignoring margins. (In the HTML output this just adds a class of `fullbleed` and sets the width to `100%`, and CSS can be used to do whatever the author or book designer chooses to accomplish the fullbleed effect.) The integer values between 1 and 100 mean to resize the image to that percentage width of the page, respecting margins--so `100` means to be 100% of the usable page width, but not spilling into the margins.

`type`
: For an image, the `type` attribute is redundant, as the default type of a Figure is `image`. However, if you feel like it, you can add the `type` attribute with the value `image` if you choose. The reason that the `type` attribute exists on a figure is to allow the figure variant of the image syntax to also support inserting [audio](#audio) and [video](#video); see those chapters for details.

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Figures with Alt Text and a Caption

Ideally, a figure should have both alt text and a caption. The alt text is intended for readers who can't see the image, and the caption is intended to complement the image.

## Resource Type: Image, Code, Math, Text, Audio and Video

Markua Processors rely on file extension to determine the type of media and must not attempt to parse files to determine their type. Because of this, the choice of acceptable file extensions for the various media types is a subset of the total available, so that audio and video files can be distinguished solely by their file extension instead of by examining the file or by requiring authors to type some special metadata syntax.

### Image Formats

Markua supports GIF, PNG, JPEG and SVG images. The images must have the correct file extension for their type. Markua processors do not need to parse images to determine their type.

The supported file extensions are:

.gif
: The file is treated as a GIF image.

.jpg
: The file is treated as a JPEG image.

.jpeg
: The file is treated as a JPEG image.

.png
: The file is treated as a PNG image.

.svg
: The image is treated as an SVG image.

.svgz
: The image is treated as an SVG image which has been zipped.

.xml
: The image is treated as an SVG image.

### Video Formats

Markua supports MP4 and WebM videos. The videos must have the correct file extension for their type.

The supported file extensions for video files are:

.mp4
: The file is treated as an MP4 video.

.webm
: The file is treated as a WebM image.

A> For those familiar with HTML5 video: the `mediagroup` syntax and/or the use of `source` elements is not currently supported in Markua. A syntax for producing these may be added in future Markua versions.

If a Markua Processor is outputting a format in which particular types of audio or video resources are not supported, a missing audio or video image placeholder must be output. The look of this missing audio or video image is not specified in Markua; it can either be deliberately ugly (like the missing image icon in web browsers circa 1995) or it can be attractive.

If a Markua Processor is outputting a print book or some format where it is known that video resources are not supported, it must choose the poster to use as an image replacement. (This includes situations where the video is identified by a URL and only local video resources are supported by the particular Markua Processor.)

### Audio Formats

Markua supports MP3, AAC, Ogg and WAV audio files.

The supported file extensions for audio files are:

.mp3
: The file is treated as MP3 audio.

.m4a, .aac
: The file is treated as an MP4 AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio file. Note that .mp4 is not supported as a file extension for MP4 AAC audio, since that is the file extension used for MP4 video.

.wav, .wave
: The file is treated as a WAV (Waveform Audio File Format) file.

.ogg, .oga
: The file is treated as an Ogg Vorbis file.

### Text Resources

TODO - explain this, and include custom types of text resources

A> For the programmers reading this: since resources cannot themselves include resources, you cannot have cycles resulting in infinitely long Markua documents.
