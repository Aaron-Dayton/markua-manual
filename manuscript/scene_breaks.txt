# Scene Breaks

In fiction, scene breaks are sometimes added between paragraphs in a chapter to denote a break in context.

To make a scene break, create a line which has only hyphens, asterisks or underscores on it, and which has at least three of them. There may be whitespace between the hyphens or asterisks. Scene breaks must have a blank line above them and below them.

Markua Processors can take great liberties in how they display scene breaks in non-HTML outputs. For example, scene breaks can be displayed as a few centered asterisks, an image, or just a blank line, depending on whether the book is fiction or another type of book.

Scene breaks map to the `hr` element in HTML.
