# Scene Breaks

To make a scene break, place exactly three hyphens on a line by themselves. Scene breaks must have a blank line above them and below them.

Markua Processors can take great liberties in how they display scene breaks in non-HTML outputs. For example, scene breaks can be displayed as a few centered asterisks, an image, or just a blank line, depending on whether the book is fiction or another type of book.

Scene breaks map to the `hr` element in HTML.

#### Example

##### Markua Syntax

```
Yada yada yada.

---

Yada yada yada.
```

##### HTML Output

```
<p>Yada yada yada.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Yada yada yada.</p>
```
