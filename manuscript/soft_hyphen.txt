In certain rare situations, it's desirable to be able to give hints to a Markua Processor about where hypenation can be done.

To insert a soft hyphen, used a backslash followed by a hyphen:

## Markua Syntax

```
You can use soft hyphens to suggest where to break long words like Rumpel\-stiltskin if you wish.
```

## HTML Output

<p>You can use soft hyphens to suggest where to break long words like Rumpel&shy;stiltskin if you wish.</p>

## Example Output

You can use soft hyphens to suggest where to break long words like Rumpel-stiltskin if you wish.
