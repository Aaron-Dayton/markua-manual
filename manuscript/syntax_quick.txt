# Markua Syntax Quick Reference

Markua syntax is heavily based on Markdown syntax, and is adapted for the needs of books and documents. This is a quick reference to all of Markua's syntax, focusing on the happy path of how you are supposed to write Markua, and ignoring the complex edge cases. In some cases, the HTML that is generated is mentioned.

To learn why Markua is the way it is, and for the proper specification of Markua and of the HTML produced, read the rest of the spec. If you just want to know how to type proper Markua and assume that everything else just works, read this.

## Text Formatting

* To produce *italic text*, surround it with either `_one underscore_` (producing `<i>`) or `*one asterisk*` (producing `<em>`).
* To produce **bold text**, surround it with either `__two underscores__` (producing `<b>`) or `**two asterisks**` (producing `<strong>`).
* To produce ***bold + italic text***, surround it with either `__three underscores__` (producing `<b><i>`), `**three asterisks**` (producing `<strong><em>`).
* To produce ____underlined text____, surround it with `____four underscores____` (producing `<u>`). (Usually italic text is preferred to underlined text, but not always. The syntax for underlined text is gross, but this is a tradeoff.)
* To produce ~~strikethrough text~~, surround it with `~~two tildes~~`.
* To produce superscript like the 3 in 5^3^ = 125, surround it with carets like `5^3^ = 125`.
* To produce subscript like the 2 in

 like the 3 in 5^3^ = 125, surround it with carets like `5^3^ = 125`.

## Subscript

To make a span be in subscript, you surround it with one tilde each. (This is the same syntax as is used by pandoc.)
