# Markua Syntax Quick Reference

Markua syntax is heavily based on Markdown syntax, and is adapted for the needs of books and documents. This is a quick reference to all of Markua's syntax, focusing on the "happy path" instead of complex edge cases. In some cases, the HTML that is generated is mentioned. For a proper explanation of Markua and the complete specification of the HTML produced, read the rest of the spec. If you just want to know how to type proper Markua and assume that everything else just works, read this.

## Text Formatting

* To produce *italic text*, surround it with either `_one underscore_` (producing `<i>`) or `*one asterisk*` (producing `<em>`).
* To produce **bold text**, surround it with either `__two underscores__` (producing `<b>`) or `**two asterisks**` (producing `<strong>`).
* To produce ***bold + italic text***, surround it with either `__three underscores__` (producing `<b><i>`), `**three asterisks**` (producing `<strong><em>`).

## Underlined Text

Believe it or not, underline is not just a typewriter version of italics. In some languages, underlining serves a distinct, legitimate purpose.

So, how to support this in Markua?

The combination of one, two and three underscores have all been taken. So have the combination of one, two and three asterisks. So, we're left with `____four underscores____` for underlining. This is a bit gross, but thankfully, underlining is a lot less used than bold and italics in most languages.

### Example

#### Markua Syntax

{#input_underline_1}
```
This is ____some underlined____ text.
```

#### HTML Output

The HTML which is output uses the `<u>` tag, which was added to HTML5.

{#output_underline_1}
```
<p>This is some <u>bold and italic</u> text.</p>
```

## Strikethrough

Strikethrough is made with `~~two tildes~~` surrounding the text. (This is the same syntax as is used by John Macfarlane's excellent [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html).)

### Example

#### Markua Syntax

{#input_strikethrough_1}
```
Strikethrough is made with ~~two tildes~~ surrounding the text.
```

#### HTML Output

{#output_strikethrough_1}
```
<p>Strikethrough is made with <span class="strikethrough">two tildes</span> surrounding the text.</p>
```

Markua never specifies CSS, to allow for maximum flexibility and competition on behalf of Markua Processor implementations.

However, in this case, the following CSS rule is strongly recommended:

```
.strikethrough {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

## Superscript

To make a span be in superscript, you surround it with carets. (This is the same syntax as is used by pandoc.)

### Example

#### Markua Syntax

{#input_superscript_1}
```
5^3^ is 125.
```

#### HTML Output

{#output_superscript_1}
```
<p>5<sup>3</sup> is 125.</p>
```

## Subscript

To make a span be in subscript, you surround it with one tilde each. (This is the same syntax as is used by pandoc.)

### Example

#### Markua Syntax

{#input_subscript_1}
```
What he thought was H~2~O was H~2~SO~4~.
```

#### HTML Output

{#output_subscript_1}
```
<p>What he thought was H<sub>2</sub>O was H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
```
