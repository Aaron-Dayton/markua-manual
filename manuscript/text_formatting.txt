# Text Formatting

Markua is a plain text format designed for the writing of books and documents. Books and documents have various types of text formatting in them: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, superscript and subscript.

A> To learn about the hilarious issues around bold and italic text in HTML and why there are two ways of producing bold and italic text in Markua, see the Appendix [The W3C and Semantic Emphasis](w3c_semantic_emphasis).

## Italic Text

You can make a span of text italic in Markua by surrounding it with either `_one underscore_` or `*one asterisk*`. The HTML that is generated is different: single underscores produce the `<i>` tag, whereas single asterisks produce the `<em>` tag. Both, however, will look italic.

### Example

{#input_italic_1}
#### Markua Syntax

```
This text _is italic_. This text *is also italic*.
```

{#output_italic_1}
#### HTML Output

```
<p>This text <i>is italic</i>. This text <em>is also italic</em>.</p>
```
