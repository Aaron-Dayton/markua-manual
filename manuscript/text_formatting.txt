# Text Formatting

Markua is a plain text format designed for the writing of books and documents. Books and documents have various types of text formatting in them: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, superscript and subscript.

A> To learn about the hilarious issues around bold and italic text in HTML and why there are two ways of producing bold and italic text in Markua, see the Appendix [The W3C and Semantic Emphasis](w3c_semantic_emphasis).

## Italic Text

You can make a span of text italic in Markua by surrounding it with either `_one underscore_` or `*one asterisk*`. The HTML that is generated is different: single underscores produce the `<i>` tag, whereas single asterisks produce the `<em>` tag. Both, however, will look italic.

### Example

{#input_italic_1}
#### Markua Syntax

```
This text _is italic_. This text *is also italic*.
```

{#output_italic_1}
#### HTML Output

```
<p>This text <i>is italic</i>. This text <em>is also italic</em>.</p>
```

## Bold Text

You can make a span of text bold in Markua by surrounding it with either `__two underscores__` or `**two asterisks**`. The HTML that is generated is different: double underscores produce the `<b>` tag, whereas double asterisks produce the `<strong>` tag. Both, however, will look bold.

### Example

{#input_bold_1}
#### Markua Syntax

```
This text __is bold__. This text **is also bold**.
```

{#output_bold_1}
#### HTML Output

```
<p>This text <b>is bold</b>. This text <strong>is also bold</strong>.</p>
```

## Bold + Italic Text

You can make a span of text bold and italic in Markua by surrounding it with either `___three underscores___` or `***two asterisks***`. The HTML that is generated is different: triple underscores produce the `<b><i>` tag combination, whereas triple asterisks produce the `<strong><em>` tag combination. Both, however, will look bold and italic.

A> Note that in cases of three asterisks or underscores consecutively, the `<b>` or `<strong>` tags are on the outside, and the `<i>` or `<em>` tags are on the inside.

{#input_bold_italic_1}
#### Markua Syntax

```
This text ___is bold and italic___. This text ***is also bold and italic***.
```

{#output_bold_italic_1}
#### HTML Output

```
<p>This text <b><i>is bold and italic</i></b>. This text <strong><em>is also bold and italic</em></strong>.</p>
```

You can even combine underscores and asterisks. This is not recommended stylistically, but it works.

{#input_bold_italic_2}
#### Markua Syntax

```
This text __*is bold and italic*__. This text **_is also bold and italic_**.

This text *__is italic and bold__*. This text _**is also italic and bold**_.
```

{#output_bold_italic_2}
#### HTML Output

```
<p>This text <b><em>is bold and italic</em></b>. This text <strong><i>is also bold and italic</i></strong>.</p>

<p>This text <em><b>is italic and bold</b></em>. This text <i><strong>is also italic and bold</strong></i>.</p>
```

## Nesting Bold in Italic, and Italic in Bold

Bold text can be nested inside italic text, and italic text can be nested in bold text. This is true for both the underscore and asterisk variants. You can even mix and match them together.

{#input_bold_1}
#### Markua Syntax

```
This text _is italic __and this is nested bold__ and this is still italic_ again.

This text *is italic **and this is nested bold** and this is still italic* again.

This text _is italic **and this is nested bold** and this is still italic_ again.

This text *is italic __and this is nested bold__ and this is still italic* again.

This text __is bold _and this is nested italic_ and this is still bold__ again.

This text **is bold *and this is nested italic* and this is still bold** again.

This text __is bold *and this is nested italic* and this is still bold__ again.

This text **is bold _and this is nested italic_ and this is still bold** again.
```

{#output_bold_1}
#### HTML Output

```
<p>This text <i>is italic <b>and this is nested bold</b> and this is still italic</i> again.</p>

<p>This text <em>is italic <strong>and this is nested bold</strong> and this is still italic</em> again.</p>

<p>This text <i>is italic <strong>and this is nested bold</strong> and this is still italic</i> again.</p>

<p>This text <em>is italic <b>and this is nested bold</b> and this is still italic</em> again.</p>

<p>This text <b>is bold <i>and this is nested italic</i> and this is still bold</b> again.</p>

<p>This text <strong>is bold <em>and this is nested italic</em> and this is still bold</strong> again.</p>

<p>This text <b>is bold <em>and this is nested italic</em> and this is still bold</b> again.</p>

<p>This text <strong>is bold <i>and this is nested italic</i> and this is still bold</strong> again.</p>
```

## Underlines with `____Four____` Underscores

Believe it or not, underline is not just a typewriter version of italics. In some languages, underlining serves a distinct, legitimate purpose.

So, how to support this in Markua?

The combination of one, two and three underscores have all been taken. So have the combination of one, two and three asterisks. So, we're left with `____four underscores____` for underlining. This is a bit gross, but thankfully, underlining is a lot less used than bold and italics in most languages.

### Markua Syntax

{#input_underline_1}
```
This is ____some underlined____ text.
```

### HTML Output

The HTML which is output uses the `<u>` tag, which was added to HTML5.

{#output_underline_1}
```
<p>This is some <u>bold and italic</u> text.</p>
```

## Invalid Nesting Is Illegal

If emphasis is nested in an invalid combination, Markua processors must simply output the formatting instead of exploding.

The following lines are all invalid in Markua:

```
This is **_not nested**_ properly.

This is also *__not nested*__ properly.

This __*must__* fail too.
```

## Strikethrough

Strikethrough is made with `~~two tildes~~` surrounding the text. (This is the same syntax as is used by John Macfarlane's excellent [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html).)

### Markua Syntax

{#input_strikethrough_1}
```
Strikethrough is made with ~~two tildes~~ surrounding the text.
```

### HTML Output

{#output_strikethrough_1}
```
<p>Strikethrough is made with <span class="strikethrough">two tildes</span> surrounding the text.</p>
```

Markua never specifies CSS, to allow for maximum flexibility and competition on behalf of Markua Processor implementations.

However, in this case, the following CSS rule is strongly recommended:

```
.strikethrough {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

## Superscript

To make a span be in superscript, you surround it with carets. (This is the same syntax as is used by pandoc.)

### Markua Syntax

{#input_superscript_1}
```
5^3^ is 125.
```

### HTML Output

{#output_superscript_1}
```
<p>5<sup>3</sup> is 125.</p>
```

## Subscript

To make a span be in subscript, you surround it with one tilde each. (This is the same syntax as is used by pandoc.)

### Markua Syntax

{#input_subscript_1}
```
What he thought was H~2~O was H~2~SO~4~.
```

### HTML Output

{#output_subscript_1}
```
<p>What he thought was H<sub>2</sub>O was H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
```
