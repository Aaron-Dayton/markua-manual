# Video

The Markua video syntax can be briefly described as follows:
`![Optional Alt Text](path_or_url_to_video "Optional Figure Caption")`

In Markua, video can be inserted using the Figure syntax, on a line by itself.

The optional figure caption is described in the [Figures](#figures) section below; the alt text and image path are described below.

## Alt text

In the Markua video syntax, just as with the Markdown image syntax, the optional alt text is in square brackets before the image:
`![Optional Alt Text](path/to/image.png "Optional Figure Caption")`
