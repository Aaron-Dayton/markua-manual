# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LEANPUB AUTHORS: MARKUA IS NOT YET LIVE IN LEANPUB!

**Markua support is NOT live in Leanpub yet for anyone but admins. Heck, Markua is not even fully-specified yet. This spec is in-progress.**

If you're reading this, you are a really, *really* early adopter of Markua.

I'm publishing the Markua spec in-progress, since I believe in [Lean Publishing](https://leanpub.com/lean). (Lean Publishing is the act of publishing an in-progress book using lightweight tools and many iterations to get reader feedback, pivot until you have the right book and build traction once you do.)

We should have Markua live in Leanpub the next 2-3 months.  In the meantime, what Leanpub books are written in is what they have been written in for about 5 years: [Leanpub Flavoured Markdown, which is documented at this link](https://leanpub.com/help/manual).

The good news is that Leanpub Flavoured Markdown is very similar to Markua. So, if you've been thinking that you were writing in Markua and then wondered why a couple things didn't work, it's because they work differently in Leanpub Flavoured Markdown.

When Markua support is live on Leanpub we will provide the option of writing either in Markua or in Leanpub Flavoured Markdown. We'll also have a 1-click "Convert my Manuscript to Markua" button. So, as you read this spec, don't worry about having to do a bunch of work converting your books: Leanpub will do this for you. We're also going to keep support for Leanpub Flavoured Markdown for the foreseeable future.

So, in the meantime, please enjoy using Leanpub and Leanpub Flavoured Markdown.

Thanks,
Peter Armstrong
